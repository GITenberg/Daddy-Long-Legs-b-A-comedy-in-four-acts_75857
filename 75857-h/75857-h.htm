</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='small'>A comedy in 3 acts, by F. Tennison Jesse and H. Harwood. 4
males, 5 females. One easy interior scene. A charming comedy,
constructed with uncommon skill, and abounds with clever lines.
Margaret Anglin’s big success. Amateurs will find this comedy easy
to produce and popular with
all audiences.</span> <span class="price"><span class='small'>Price, 60 Cents.</span></span></p>

    <div><span class='large'>NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='small'>A comedy in 3 acts. By James Montgomery. 5 males, 6 females.
Costumes, modern. Two interior scenes. Plays 2½ hours.</span></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='small'>Is it possible to tell the absolute truth—even for twenty-four hours?
It is—at least Bob Bennett, the hero of “Nothing But the Truth,”
accomplished the feat. The bet he made with his business partners,
and the trouble he got into—with his partners, his friends, and his
fiancée—this is the subject of William Collier’s tremendous comedy
hit. “Nothing But the Truth” can be wholeheartedly recommended
as one of the most sprightly, amusing and popular comedies that this
country can
boast.</span> <span class="price"><span class='small'>Price, 60 Cents.</span></span></p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='large'>IN WALKED JIMMY.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='small'>A comedy in 4 acts, by Minnie Z. Jaffa. 10 males, 2 females (although
any number of males and females may be used as clerks,
etc.). Two interior scenes. Costumes, modern. Plays 2½ hours.
The thing into which Jimmy walked was a broken-down shoe factory,
when the clerks had all been fired, and when the proprietor was in
serious contemplation of suicide.</span></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='small'>Jimmy, nothing else but plain Jimmy, would have been a mysterious
figure had it not been for his matter-of-fact manner, his smile and
his everlasting humanness. He put the shoe business on its feet, won
the heart of the girl clerk, saved her erring brother from jail, escaped
that place as a permanent boarding house himself, and foiled the
villain.</span></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='small'>Clean, wholesome comedy with just a touch of human nature, just
a dash of excitement and more than a little bit of true philosophy
make “In Walked Jimmy” one of the most delightful of plays.
Jimmy is full of the religion of life, the religion of happiness, and
the religion of helpfulness, and he so permeates the atmosphere with
his “religion” that everyone is happy. The spirit of optimism, good
cheer, and hearty laughter dominates the play. There is not a dull
moment in any of the
four acts. We strongly recommend it.</span> <span class="price"><span class='small'>Price, 60 Cents.</span></span></p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div><span class='large'>MARTHA BY-THE-DAY.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='small'>An optimistic comedy in three acts, by Julie M. Lippmann, author
of the “Martha” stories. 5 males, 5 females. Three interior scenes.
Costumes modern. Plays 2½ hours.</span></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='small'>It is altogether a gentle thing, this play. It is full of quaint humor,
old-fashioned, homely sentiment, the kind that people who see
the play will recall and chuckle over to-morrow and the next day.</span></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='small'>Miss Lippmann has herself adapted her very successful book for
stage service, and in doing this has selected from her novel the most
telling incidents, infectious comedy and homely sentiment for the play, and the
result is thoroughly delightful.</span> <span class="price"><span class='small'>Price, 60 Cents.</span></span></p>

table and <span class='sc'>Loretta</span> on the stool below table, engaged
in cleaning silver. <span class='sc'>Gladiola</span> is up stage
behind upper table <span class='fss'>R.</span> polishing a cup. After
the curtain is well up, <span class='sc'>Gladiola</span> mounts on
chair before cupboard to place cup in cupboard
and <span class='sc'>Freddie Perkins</span> enters at lower <span class='fss'>R. I.</span></i></p>

<p class='c015'><i>They are dressed exactly alike in stiffly
starched gingham pinafores (blue) with a row
of white china buttons down the back and a
suggestion of red flannel petticoat showing
beneath. Each child has her hair strained back
tightly and braided into two pig-tails. They sit
nervously and work steadily and silently with
no attempt at childish chatter. Freddie Perkins
is about nine years old and is dressed in dark
knickerbockers and a jumper made of the same
striped blue gingham that the girls are wearing.
His hair is shaved close to his head.</i></p>

down immediately. I never knew anyone like that

Gladiola Murphy! Aren’t you ashamed? That’s
a pretty looking sugar bowl to send up to the
trustees. You take it into the pantry and wash it.
(<i>She gives the bowl to <span class='sc'>Gladiola</span>, faces her toward

Half past four! It’s time to make the tea. (<i>Goes up

(<i>Comes down <span class='fss'>C.</span></i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> I’m sorry. The nurse had to look after
the sick babies and we couldn’t leave the others
alone.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Mrs. L.</span> You always have plenty of excuses.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> That new little red-headed child has licked
all the green paint off the Noah’s Ark—</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Mrs. L.</span> And what do you think I was doing?
Cutting the cake with one hand and receiving the
guests with the other?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> That red-headed child has swallowed some
green paint—</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Mrs. L.</span> I don’t care what that red-headed child
has swallowed. I’m more interested in what the
trustees are going to swallow.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Speaking very hurriedly</i>) That red-headed
child has licked the green paint off the roof of
the Noah’s Ark, and I think you’d better send for
the doctor.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Mrs. L.</span> Will you stop talking and get to work?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Going <span class='fss'>R.</span></i>) It was <em>green</em> and I’m afraid
it will disagree with him.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Mrs. L.</span> You’ve learned altogether too much!

Mrs. Lippett⸺</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Mrs. L.</span> (<i>Over her shoulder</i>) Well?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Did you put those two guinea pigs into
the babies’ bath tub?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Mrs. L.</span> (<i>Whirling about</i>) Guinea pigs!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> I think they’re guinea pigs. Little brown
and white animals … about so big.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Mrs. L.</span> Oh, good heavens! Those horrible
boys!—What did you do with the beasts?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> I didn’t touch them. I thought—</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Mrs. L.</span> (<i>Crossing to table <span class='fss'>R.</span></i>) Quick! Get them
away before the trustees find them.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Coming down <span class='fss'>R.</span></i>) I thought maybe that
generous new trustee you were telling us about
brought them as a present for the babies.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Mrs. L.</span> And you thought I was planning to keep
them in the nursery bathtub?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> It’s so seldom used! <a id='tn-rie'></a>(<i>Exits <span class='fss'>R. I. E.</span>

pigs! (<i><span class='sc'>Gladiola</span> comes down from the pantry with

off the face of the earth. (<i><span class='sc'>Sadie Kate</span> and <span class='sc'>Loretta</span>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. L.</span> That you are sending to technical school.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Oh, yes, yes! The young engineers!

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Mrs. L.</span> I trust their reports are sent every

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Yes, I believe so. (<i><span class='sc'>Miss Pritchard</span> up

after them. (<i>Sits on bench, studies children intently.

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Mrs. L.</span> (<i>Behind <span class='sc'>Jervis</span> and over his shoulder

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Gladiola.</span> (<i>Wilting with embarrassment</i>) Y-yes,

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span><span class='sc'>Jervis</span> (<i>Rising, his arm about <span class='sc'>Gladiola</span>, crossing
over <span class='fss'>L. C.</span> to <span class='sc'>Miss P.</span></i>) Happy, bubbling, laughing

<p class='c017'>(<i>Children exit <span class='fss'>L.</span> at <span class='sc'>Mrs. L.’s</span> gesture.</i>)</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. L.</span> (<i>Coming to <span class='fss'>R. C.</span></i>) It’s a great pleasure

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Turns around and sees text at back <span class='fss'>C.</span></i>)
Of course! Of course! Ah! (<i>Indicating text</i>)
The Lord will provide! (<i>To <span class='sc'>Miss P.</span></i>) Very touching!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Mrs. L.</span> (<span class='fss'>R. C.</span>) You wouldn’t want us to bring
them up without religion?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Deprecating the idea</i>) No, no. But
why not teach them the truth? The Lord will provide
for the rich. The poor must provide for themselves.
(<i>Turns to <span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> and sets cup on table.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Wykoff.</span> (<i><span class='fss'>C.</span> and <span class='fss'>R.</span> of <span class='sc'>Jervis</span></i>) Well, I’m a

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Yes—yes⸺</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Wykoff.</span> Er—er—I’m convinced! (<i>Turns to

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<span class='fss'>R.</span>) Poor little kiddies. (<i>Turning to

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> (<span class='fss'>L.</span>) What do you mean, Jervis?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Why, you can’t bring them up like chickens
in batches of a hundred like chickens in an incubator.
It isn’t natural—it won’t work.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> (<i>To <span class='fss'>L. C.</span> Sits <span class='fss'>R.</span></i>) Jervis! (<i>He turns</i>)
I hate to be always begging. But there’s one of
these children for whom I should so love to manage
a future.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Good-naturedly</i>) Another promising
engineer?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> No—this time—it’s a girl.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>In consternation</i>) A girl! My dear
lady!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> And such a pretty one!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Amazed, crossing over <span class='fss'>L.</span></i>) Oh, no! You
can’t catch me with that bait!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> She’s more than pretty. (<i>Sits bench <span class='fss'>R.</span>
of table <span class='fss'>L.</span></i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Wearily. Hands in pocket, crosses down
<span class='fss'>R.</span></i>) I know—she has a good record and deserves⸺</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> She has the worst record of any child
in this Home.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Interested</i>) What!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> She doesn’t lie out of her misdemeanors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>as the others do. She is disobedient and impertinent
but⸺</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> And just what is it you want me to do
for this pretty, disobedient, impertinent young person?
(<i>Up around table <span class='fss'>R.</span></i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> I want you—to send her to college.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> What? To college? From an orphan
asylum? Impossible!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> She’s eighteen. (<i><span class='sc'>Jervis</span> faces front</i>)
And ready to graduate from the High School.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Facing <span class='sc'>Miss P.</span></i>) So? I thought they
never kept them after fourteen?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> Judy Abbott was so unusually bright
that the Board of Trustees let her stay on and attend
the village school.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Very generous!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> Of course it saved hiring someone to
take care of the younger children.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Thrifty and generous.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> And she has done remarkable work in
English. Her teachers say that she would make an
author if she had the training.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> An author? There are too many authors
in the world already. (<i>Crosses to her.</i>) I don’t wish
to make any more.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> (<i>Solemnly</i>) Suppose she should be a
genius? Have you any right to keep her down?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> If she were a genius I couldn’t keep her
down. Do you think she would placidly stand all
this? (<i>With a comprehensive gesture about the
room</i>) She would rise and mutiny if she had any
spirit.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> But she’s only eighteen, and if you only
knew⸺</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Facing <span class='sc'>Miss P.</span>, stubbornly shaking his
head</i>) We all have the right to a few prejudices.
You know yourself that you won’t eat bananas.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>No reason in the world except that you don’t like
bananas. Now I have an antipathy, too, I don’t
like girls. Never did like ’em. Never will like ’em.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> (<i>Rises. <span class='sc'>Jervis</span> walks <span class='fss'>L.</span> <span class='sc'>Miss Pritchard</span>
rises</i>) You are a crabbed, ill-natured, hard-shelled,
old bachelor, and you don’t know what you
are talking about! You’ve never known any girls.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Never known any? That precious sister-in-law
of mine has a daughter coming on exactly
like her.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> Baby Julia?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Turns away</i>) Baby Julia enters college
next September.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> Think of that!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> I might arrange for your impertinent
orphan to room with my aristocratic niece.
(<i>Chuckles at the idea</i>) That would be rather a neat
joke on the Pendleton family!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> (<i>With asperity</i>) My little Judy deserves
a chance for her own sake.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> You damned her chance when you said
she was pretty.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> Why?</p>

<div class='c018'><i>Children READY</i></div>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Why? Why, I’d no sooner get her educated
than some young whippersnapper would come
along and want to marry her. Education thrown
away. I’d rather put my money into a permanent
investment.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> Do you really mean it, or is it just one
of your stupid jokes?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Seriously</i>) I really mean it. How
could one of these orphans compete with the class
of girls she would meet in college? (<i>Crosses <span class='fss'>R.</span></i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> But you haven’t seen my Judy.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> No. But I have seen this institution
and I know that no child that was ever born could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>live eighteen years in the John Grier Home and
have spirit enough left to fight the world. (<i>Crossing
<span class='fss'>L. C.</span></i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> But my Judy’s different. Give her a
chance.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> My dear Miss Pritchard! In college
your little Judy wouldn’t have a chance. Do you
think they’d take in an outsider—from an orphan
asylum?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> It’s not fair.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Bitterly</i>) Nothing’s fair. But it’s a
fact. Don’t you see that it would be no kindness to
the girl? We should just be showing her a glimpse
of a bigger, more beautiful life, such as she has
never dreamed of, and then forbidding her to enter.
No, no. Society has thrown away your little Judy—(<i>Hands
in pockets</i>)—and it’s too late now to pick
up the pieces.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> (<i><span class='fss'>L.C.</span>, crushed</i>) Yes—but it’s cruel.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>To <span class='sc'>Miss P.</span>, drawing her hand through
his arm</i>) Well! Well! Come and let’s have a look
at that scandalous dark playroom. (<i>Going up <span class='fss'>C.</span></i>)
Maybe you can induce me to build a new one. (<i>They
go out <span class='fss'>C.</span> and <span class='fss'>L.</span></i>)</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i>As <span class='sc'>Jervis</span> and <span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> exit both ad lib, <span class='sc'>Sadie

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>At work smoothing out aprons</i>) Yes,

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Mrs. L.</span> Seems though everything’s gone wrong
to-day. And just when we’ve got a rich trustee up
from New York. (<i>Turning to <span class='fss'>L.</span> window <span class='fss'>R.</span></i>) He’s

Well, what are you laughing at? It’s no laughing
matter. Can’t you keep that child mended?</p>

Nothing but patches.</p>

you make those sandwiches?</p>

earned my living in the John Grier Home. I have
worked from the time I was a tiny child. For three
years straight I polished brass door knobs until
you discovered that I was clever enough to do other
things. And you haven’t kept me all this extra time
just for my own good. When I was eleven years
old that lady wanted to adopt me. But you made
her take another child instead, because I was useful.
I might have had a home, too—like other children—and
you stole it away from me. And you call me
ungrateful because I’m glad to go? I don’t care
<em>how hard</em> it will be. I can make my own way in the
world. Just give me a chance. Anywhere—out of
the shadow of this asylum, and I will prove what I
am good for. I’ve lived eighteen years in prison.

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> (<i>Coming down <span class='fss'>C.</span></i>) I am sorry this had

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Angry? Oh, no, no! (<i>Crosses over <span class='fss'>R.</span> of
<span class='fss'>C.</span></i>) I was only hesitating because—well—I must
be sure I’m doing the best thing for the girl. But,
by jove! (<i>Turns to <span class='sc'>Miss P.</span></i>) It was great to see
that little thing rise up and demand her right to
live. She shall have it! (<i>Looks off <span class='fss'>R. I. E.</span> and then

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> (<span class='fss'>C.</span>) What!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Turns to <span class='sc'>Miss P.</span></i>) I’ll send her to college!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> (<i>Joyfully</i>) That <em>is</em> generous!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Gruffly</i>) Nonsense! I’m interested.
I’d like to see if the girl really can pull it off!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> She will be so <em>grateful</em>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Crossing <span class='fss'>L.</span></i>) No, no. None of that. She’s
never to know who does it.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> She will want to thank you.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Well, she can’t. I won’t have it. Why!
She’s had to give thanks for every mouthful she
ever ate! I wonder she didn’t choke. This college
business comes as a free gift from Heaven.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> Don’t you want to watch her progress?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> A college doesn’t send reports.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Sits. Thinking out loud</i>) Well, let me
see. We’re to make a writer of the girl? H’m—there’s
no better practice in composition than good,
old-fashioned letter writing. She may write me a
letter on the first of every month, telling about her
studies and her daily life—just such a letter as she
would write to her parents—if—she had any.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> She will have to know your name.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Tell her Smith. John Smith. She will
address her letters to Mr. John Smith—in care of
my secretary, just as the boys do their reports.
But she’s never to expect any answer. (<i>Rises</i>) I
can’t have Judy a nuisance.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> I will explain the best I can. (<i>Rises.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> And don’t explain to anyone else. We

one year later. A <a href='#stage142'>plan</a> and <a href='#scene-2'>full description</a> of

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>At Rise</span>: <i><span class='sc'>Julia</span> and <span class='sc'>Sallie</span> are discovered hastily

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Sallie.</span> (<i>Coming down <span class='fss'>L.</span> of <span class='fss'>C.</span> table</i>) Did you
like the basket-ball game, Mrs. Pendleton?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Mrs. P.</span> (<i>Sitting <span class='fss'>L.</span> of table</i>) It was very unladylike.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> (<i>Sitting <span class='fss'>R.</span> of table</i>) She had to go to
a rehearsal. (<i>Sits.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Sallie.</span> She has too many engagements. (<i>Up to

Abbott come from?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> (<i>Coming <span class='fss'>R.</span> of <span class='sc'>Mrs. Pendleton</span></i>) I

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> She told me that she was descended from

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Yes, I know. He ought to be chloroformed.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> (<i>Laughs</i>) And don’t let the kettle boil
over. (<i>Exits with <span class='sc'>Jimmie</span>, closing door.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Crossing to <span class='fss'>R.</span> of table <span class='fss'>C.</span>, and a little

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> Yes.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Well?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> (<i>Crossing to <span class='sc'>Jervis</span></i>) Oh, she’s wonderful!
I don’t believe you’d recognize her.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> I was trying to remember the other day

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Cross <span class='fss'>L.</span></i>) No. Nothing will surprise me
any more.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> What do you mean?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> I’ve had nineteen letters from Judy this
winter.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> You answer them?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> <em>No!</em> Of course I don’t answer them.
I told you I wouldn’t.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> But you <em>read</em> them?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Yes, certainly. Why not?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> I was afraid—maybe you’d turn them
over to your secretary.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Down in front of table, hands in pockets</i>)
Oh, no! Little Judy’s letters are not the sort
I could allow my secretary to read.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> (<i>Anxiously</i>) What are they like?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Teasing her</i>) Disgraceful!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> (<i>Horrified. Rises</i>) What?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Shocking!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> Jervis!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Scandalous!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> Oh, no!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> She makes love to me.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> The child thinks you are her father.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> The child knows perfectly well that I am
not her father.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> She thinks you are an old man.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Rises. Indignantly</i>) I’m not an old
man. I won’t be treated like an old man.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> Please don’t be angry⸺</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> She draws pictures of me. (<i>Sits <span class='fss'>L.</span> of
table.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> Oh! I’m sorry⸺</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> She draws me bald-headed—without any
hair—and legs that are long.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> (<i>Firmly</i>) It’s not right.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> She calls me “Daddy Long-Legs.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> I shall give her a good scolding. I
can’t have her treating you with disrespect.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> I think I rather like being treated with
disrespect.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> (<i>Reproachfully</i>) You were joking?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> I think Daddy Long-Legs is a very nice
name.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> Then you don’t regret taking charge of
her?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Regret it? My dear lady! Her letters
alone have been worth the price of admission.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> You must see the child.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> See her? Well, rather. You didn’t suppose
I came up here to look at my niece. (<i>Cross to
<span class='fss'>C.L.</span> to table.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> (<i>Sits <span class='fss'>R.</span> of <span class='fss'>C.</span></i>) Jervis⸺ (<i>He stops
<span class='fss'>C.</span> of table and turns to her</i>) It was foolish putting
Judy in with those two girls.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Why?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> You know how particular your sister-in-law
is about the people Julia meets and if she
ever discovers the truth⸺</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Hands up in mock horror and walks
back of table</i>) There’ll be the deuce to pay!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> (<i>To <span class='fss'>R.</span> of table</i>) I don’t know why you
insisted⸺</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Comes down</i>) What else <em>could</em> I do?
I had to keep track of the girl somehow. Now,
under cover of visiting my niece, I can very conveniently
keep an eye on my ward.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> But why all this secrecy? It would be
simpler if you would just come out openly and say
you were the child’s guardian.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Come out openly? My dear lady—you
don’t know what a parcel of interfering women
I’ve got in my family. They talked enough about
the boys I am educating. Do you think they would
swallow a girl?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> It might be awkward.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> When five women, with nothing to do,
devote their energies to arranging one’s life—a simple
man might as well throw up his arms and sink.
(<i>Sits <span class='fss'>L.</span> of table <span class='fss'>R.</span></i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> I don’t blame you for being a woman-hater.
(<i><span class='sc'>Jervis</span> laughs</i>) But—make an exception in
little Judy’s case.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Rising and coming to <span class='fss'>L.</span> of <span class='sc'>Miss P.</span></i>)
Oh, Judy and I are going to be great friends.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> I hope so.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Why, of course we are. I feel a proprietary
interest in the girl. She belongs to me.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> Yes, yes, but the future, Jervis.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> The future?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> It’s all very well now, but—what are
we going to do with her when the vacations come?
We can’t send her back to the Home!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> That’s all settled. I’m going to send her
to a farm in Connecticut. Lock Willow’s the name.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> Lock Willow?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Mrs. Semple’s place, you know, my old

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Different people. I have a <em>guardian</em>—who
looks after me now. Daddy Long-Legs.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Mrs. P.</span> Who?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Quietly</i>) Daddy Long-Legs.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Leaning over chair <span class='fss'>L.</span></i>) That isn’t his
real name.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Just the pet name I call him by.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Mrs. P.</span> And what is the profession of this Mr.—Mr.—er⸺</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Mr. Long-Legs. He is an educator.</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i><span class='sc'>Jervis</span> sits <span class='fss'>L.</span> of <span class='sc'>Miss Pritchard</span>.</i>)</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jimmie.</span> An educator? Sounds like a biscuit!</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i>A laugh from <span class='sc'>Judy</span> and the <span class='sc'>Girls</span>.</i>)</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. P.</span> By the way, Miss Judy, do you come
from the New England Abbotts or the Virginia Abbotts?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> I believe—well, to tell the truth, I hardly
know. My father never took any interest in his
family.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Mrs. P.</span> And don’t you take an interest?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Very little. I have never even joined the
Daughters of the Revolution. (<i>Crosses to <span class='sc'>Miss
Pritchard</span>, who rises. <span class='sc'>Jervis</span> is <span class='fss'>R.</span> of <span class='sc'>Miss Pritchard</span>.</i>)
When will you see my guardian again?</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i><span class='sc'>Mrs. Pendleton</span> rises and goes up to couch. <span class='sc'>Jimmie</span>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> Very soon.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Tell him I love him dearly. Then give
him a kiss for me.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> Judy, Judy, what dreadful things you
say. (<i>Turns up stage.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> I don’t wonder it embarrasses you.
(<i>Crossing to <span class='sc'>Judy</span>. <span class='sc'>Jimmie</span> comes down, putting
candy on table.</i>) I think such messages should be
delivered in person.</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i><span class='sc'>Miss Pritchard</span> joins <span class='sc'>Mrs. Pendleton</span> up <span class='fss'>C.</span></i>)</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jimmie.</span> (<i>Coming <span class='fss'>R.C. L.</span> of <span class='sc'>Judy</span></i>) Oh, Judy,
is it true you Freshmen aren’t allowed to dance to-night?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>A step to <span class='sc'>Jimmie</span></i>) No. The gymnasium
is not big enough.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jimmie.</span> I can’t dance with you at all?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Soothingly</i>) But you may have a nice
long promenade up and down the bowling alley and
all around the swimming tank.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jimmie.</span> (<i>Grumbling</i>) I don’t want to walk all
evening. I want to dance.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Oh!</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i><span class='sc'>Mrs. Pendleton</span> leaves up stage group and drops
down to <span class='fss'>L.</span></i>)</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Then in that case you might bestow that
promenade upon me.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>To <span class='sc'>Jervis</span></i>) Oh, thank you. (<i>Turns and
looks <span class='sc'>Jimmie</span> up and down</i>) I’d hate not to have
any partners—(<i>Turning to <span class='sc'>Jervis</span></i>)—especially at
my first dance.</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i><span class='sc'>Jimmie</span> turns up and over <span class='fss'>R.</span></i>)</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span><span class='sc'>Mrs. P.</span> (<i>Down <span class='fss'>L.</span></i>) Your first dance?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>A step to <span class='fss'>C.</span></i>) This will be my first

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. P.</span> Mercy, child, how were you brought up?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Very simply. We didn’t dress for dinner.</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i><span class='sc'>Jervis</span> feels the hurt in her voice and turns away <span class='fss'>R.</span></i>)</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> If we are going to see the campus⸺
(<i><span class='sc'>Miss Pritchard</span> and <span class='sc'>Mrs. Pendleton</span> go up stage

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jimmie.</span> (<i>Comes down <span class='fss'>R.</span> of <span class='sc'>Judy</span></i>) You promised
to show me your running track.</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i><span class='sc'>Mrs. Pendleton</span> crosses to door <span class='fss'>U.R.</span></i>)</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Oh, no, indeed. You don’t like to walk
with me. Run along and join the others. I’m going
to put the room in order. (<i>Moves <span class='fss'>C.</span></i>)</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i><span class='sc'>Mrs. Pendleton</span> opens door and exits.</i>)</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> (<i>Crossing to door</i>) Come along, Jimmie.
(<i><span class='sc'>Jimmie</span> crosses to her.</i>) She’ll catch us.</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i><span class='sc'>Jimmie</span> exits with <span class='sc'>Julia</span> and <span class='sc'>Sallie</span> crosses to

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>At <span class='fss'>R.</span></i>) This doesn’t seem fair.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> It’s my turn. Besides, I’d rather. Sallie

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sallie.</span> (<i>Going out</i>) Will you come along, Miss
Pritchard?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> I’ll follow with Judy. (<i><span class='sc'>Jervis</span> exits,
leaving door open. <span class='sc'>Miss Pritchard</span> comes down
to <span class='sc'>Judy</span>. They embrace</i>) Judy—I wanted a chance
to see you alone, dear.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Isn’t it wonderful that this is Judy Abbott?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> Yes, yes! But you must remember—it
is better not to mention the asylum. (<i>Sits <span class='fss'>R.</span> of
table.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> I haven’t told a soul.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> But you say such very surprising things.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> But how can I help it? You don’t know
what it feels like to be shut up in the dark for eighteen
years and then suddenly be dumped right out
into the world.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> I know⸺</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> The cat’s out of the bag a dozen times a
day, but I grab it by its tail and pull it back.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> (<i>Laughs</i>) Yes, you must. People like—like
Mrs. Pendleton would never understand.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Do you know, she wanted to know my
mother’s maiden name.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> Oh!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> I never saw such an inquisitive old thing.
I’m going to put her in a book.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> That’s the way to take it.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Lightly</i>) She doesn’t bother me.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> You like the girls here?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Nods</i>) Yes—they like me, too. But
it’s only because I don’t wear blue gingham. (<i>Crossing
to <span class='fss'>R.</span> of <span class='sc'>Miss Pritchard</span> and turning</i>) You can
accomplish anything you want to in this world—if
you only have the right clothes.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> My dear!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> I’m wearing silk stockings. (<i>Sticks out
foot and exhibits them</i>) Isn’t that a joke? Tell
Mrs. Lippett when you see her.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> (<i>Embracing her</i>) Judy Abbott!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Sits on arm of chair</i>) Jerusha Abbott—wearing
silk—I wonder where she got that name.
Jerusha Abbott.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> What do you mean?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> I suppose she took “Jerusha” off a tombstone.
But I don’t know where she picked the “Abbott.”
Unless, maybe, out of the first page of the
telephone book.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> (<i>Distressed</i>) Why, my dear child, what
an idea!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Crosses in front of table</i>) I’d—I’d sort of
like to know.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> (<i>Rises anxiously—following her, turns
her round</i>) You are happy, dear?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Rising, facing <span class='sc'>Miss Pritchard</span> and
throwing off her momentary soberness</i>) Happy!
I’m so happy every moment that excited little thrills
chase up and down my back. I can’t wait to see
everything and try everything. I want to live faster
and faster to make up for the time I’ve lost.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> (<i>Rising and crossing to her</i>) Child!
Child! You must face life soberly. It holds many
disappointments for us all.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> No! No! I’ve left all my troubles at the
John Grier Home! Wait! I want to show you
something.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>(<i>Exits <span class='fss'>L.</span> <span class='sc'>Jervis</span> appears at open door of room,
comes down <span class='fss'>R.</span>, leaving door open.</i>)</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> I was sent to order you out to look at
the library.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> (<i>Crossing to <span class='sc'>Jervis</span> at <span class='fss'>R.</span></i>) I’m just waiting
for Judy.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> You might leave me to do that and I’ll
have a chat with her as we come along.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> Isn’t she sweet?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>About to express his delight, changes
his reply to a non-committal</i>) Yes—er—er—she
does very well.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> Now, do you take back what you said?
Is it a bad investment to educate a girl?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Doesn’t it strike you that she’s pretty
familiar with that young McBride?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> No!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> It’s just what I told you. We’ll no
sooner get her educated than some young whipper-snapper
will come along and want to marry her.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> He isn’t a whipper-snapper. He’s a
nice boy.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> He’ll be wanting to marry her.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> Well—when she’s through college⸺</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Crossly</i>) I don’t care to have my ward
throwing herself away on an overall factory.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> (<i>With a laugh</i>) Nonsense!</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i><span class='sc'>Judy</span> is heard off stage saying “Just a moment,

Did you ever see anything so lovely?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i><span class='fss'>R.</span> of <span class='fss'>C.</span></i>) Well—I’m not much⸺</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Lowering gown and looking over top in
consternation</i>) Oh, good gracious sakes alive!
How did you get here?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Through the door.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Where’s Miss Pritchard?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Library. I told her we’d come along.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Laughing</i>) Oh, I’m sorry. Just a second.
(<i>She dives back into room, leaves the gown
and re-appears, crosses to <span class='fss'>C.</span></i>) Ready?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i><span class='fss'>R.</span> by armchair</i>) That library doesn’t
appeal to me very much. Let’s wait here.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Dubiously</i>) Without a chaperone?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> I’m an uncle.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> And then, of course—you’re old.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Yes, exactly. I’m old. (<i>Motions to armchair</i>)
Suppose we sit down here and have a cozy,
elderly flirtation all by ourselves. (<i><span class='sc'>Judy</span> sits—<span class='sc'>Jervis</span>
gets chair at <span class='fss'>R.</span> and comes back and sits <span class='fss'>R.</span> of
<span class='sc'>Judy</span>.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>With a laugh</i>) Oh, I’d love to have a
flirtation with a Pendleton! That would be a beautiful
joke.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Why a joke?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> You wouldn’t understand—you know before
I came to college I never realized that anything
so superior ever existed as a Pendleton.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Oh, I see. You’ve had quite a dose of
Julia.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> She has mentioned her family. I feel that
it’s a great honor to be seated in your presence.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Gruffly</i>) You rub some sense into my
niece.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> I’m trying to do my best—but Gee Whiz!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> What?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Oh! Isn’t it ladylike to say—Gee Whiz?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Never!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Don’t you approve of slang?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Not from you! (<i>Turns away.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Would you like to hear me swear?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> No!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> I could. I’ve picked up quite a large
vocabulary from all the tough little Bowery boys
I’ve known.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Where did you ever know any tough little
Bowery boys?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> I used to be connected with a—charity.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> What sort of charity?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Oh, for children. A lot of nice, kind,
benevolent old Johnnies used to come every month
and pat them on the head and murmur, “Poor, homeless,
little waifs!” And then find fault with the way
the floors were scrubbed and have refreshments,
and go home, and forget all about them for another
month. It was very sweet.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> And what part did you play in this little
comedy?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> I? Oh, I used to watch them, and smile
a little behind their backs. (<i>She gets up in a sudden
access of fierceness</i>) I hate charitable people.
(<i><span class='sc'>Jervis</span> rises. <span class='sc'>Judy</span> turns and faces him contritely</i>)
I didn’t mean that! The only man I love in all the
world is charitable. (<i>She notices that he has risen
again, suddenly</i>) Do you have to stand up every
time I do?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Takes chair back of table <span class='fss'>R.</span></i>) It’s a
polite thing for a gentleman to do.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> It must be an awful nuisance to be a gentleman.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Eh?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> I’m glad I’m not one.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> I’m glad, too.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> You don’t like my manners, do you?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> You have very—sudden manners.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> I learned them out of a book. Cost a dollar
and fifteen cents.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> It pays to get a good quality.</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i><span class='sc'>Judy</span> takes book from shelf under table, goes back
to armchair. Sits.</i>)</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Sit down. (<i><span class='sc'>Jervis</span> sits and <span class='sc'>Judy</span> reads
from book</i>) “A lady never accepts presents from
a man but flowers and candy.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> How about that new frock?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> From Daddy Long-Legs? Oh, that’s different.
He belongs to me.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Leans forward interestedly</i>) Oh!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Turns another page</i>) “When a lady
breaks her engagement to marry a man, she returns
all his presents.” That’s a very useful thing to
know. (<i>Rises, <span class='sc'>Jervis</span> also rises, laughing heartily.
<span class='sc'>Judy</span> tosses book on table with a laugh</i>) Isn’t it
silly? (<i>Crosses to <span class='fss'>C.</span> in front of table.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Crosses to armchair</i>) You stay kind-hearted
and don’t hurt people’s feelings—and that’s
all the manners you need.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Turning to him</i>) You know, Mr. Pendleton,
I like you. You are so sort of sensible, and
grown-up⸺</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> And old⸺</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> I wish I had an uncle! I wish I had a <em>lot</em>
of family.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> I am entirely at your disposal. Anything
you wish—by adoption.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Really?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Yes.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> I want a grandmother more than anything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>in the world. Will you be my grandmother,
Mr. Pendleton?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> No, I take that offer back. (<i>To armchair</i>)
We’ll just be friends.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>With a sigh</i>) It’s sometimes awfully
lonely without a family.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> It’s sometimes awfully lonely with a family.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Thoughtfully</i>) But at least I’ve escaped
one thing. I never get homesick. (<i>Turns away.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Breaks situation</i>) Where are you
spending your vacation this summer?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> On a farm in Connecticut. But I wanted
to go to the McBrides’ camp in the Adirondacks.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Well, why don’t you go?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Daddy Long-Legs wouldn’t let me.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>A step to <span class='fss'>C.</span></i>) I see. Who owns this
farm? (<i>Hands in pockets.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Mrs. Semple.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Mrs. Semple?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Lock Willow’s the name.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Lock Willow! Well, well. Isn’t that a
coincidence. Lizzie Semple was my nurse when I
was a little shaver.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>A step back</i>) Your nurse?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Yes.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Gee whiz! (<i>Turns away.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Take care.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Turns to him</i>) She must be awfully
old.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Well, she’s coming on. It’s some time
since I sat on Lizzie’s lap and had my face washed.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Laughs</i>) How funny!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Crossing to <span class='fss'>C.</span> of table</i>) I occasionally
motor through that country and stop for a little
fishing. Maybe I’ll see you.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> That will be very nice. (<i>Suddenly crosses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>over to <span class='fss'>L.</span> and up as <span class='sc'>Jervis</span>, stunned by his abrupt
dismissal, turns front</i>) Thanks.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Crossing over <span class='fss'>R.</span> and then turning to her</i>)
And what are you doing in college? Have you
learned anything?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Coming to <span class='fss'>L.</span> of chair, reproachfully</i>)
Have I learned anything? The area of the convex
surface of the frustum of a regular pyramid is half
the product of the sum of the perimeters of its bases
by the altitude of either of its trapezoids.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Bowing</i>) That is very impressive.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Behind table</i>) I’ve finished—physiology.
I know all about your insides.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Um—yes⸺</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Crossing to armchair</i>) I hope you never
touch alcohol, Mr. Pendleton. It does dreadful
things to your liver.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Thank you—I will remember.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Sitting in armchair</i>) Did you know that
we used to be monkeys?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Sitting <span class='fss'>R.</span> of <span class='sc'>Judy</span></i>) I’ve heard rumors.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> You, just as much as me.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> And why not?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> But, of course, the Pendletons are descended
from very superior monkeys—with beautiful
silky hair and extra long tails.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Oh!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Did you ever read Hamlet?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Yes.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Isn’t it corking?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Eh?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Every night I put myself to sleep by pretending
that I’m the heroine of whatever book I’m
reading. Do you ever do that?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> I never have.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Just now I’m Ophelia!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Ophelia?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Hamlet and I are married. The King
and Queen are dead. But Hamlet didn’t kill them.
They just died of—pneumonia.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Um—much more modern idea.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> You know—Hamlet and I are having a
perfectly lovely time. I’ve entirely cured him of
being melancholy. He attends to the governing and
I look after the charities. We’ve just founded the
most remarkable orphan asylum. All of the children
are happy.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> And you, Miss Judy? Are you happy?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Happy? (<i>Rises—<span class='sc'>Jervis</span>, too</i>) I’m the
happiest person in the whole wide world.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Tell me the secret.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> We have ice-cream twice a week—(<i>Goes
to <span class='fss'>R.</span> of table</i>)—and we never have corn-meal mush.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> That’s something.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i><span class='fss'>R.</span> of table, facing him, hands on table</i>)
And I’ve lots of friends, and I’ve passed my examinations,
and I’ve won a short story prize⸺</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Good!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> And I’ve made the basket-ball team—(<i>Stands
up</i>)—and I have eight new dresses—all of
them different colors, and not, not one blue gingham.
(<i>Turning away.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> You don’t admire blue gingham?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> No! I shudder at the thought! (<i>Crosses
over <span class='fss'>L.</span></i>) Talk about something else quick. (<i>Goes
up. <span class='sc'>Jervis</span> glances about the room.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> What shall we talk about? (<i>Turning
up a little</i>) Did you girls furnish this room yourselves?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Coming to table <span class='fss'>C.</span></i>) The expensive
things are Julia’s. It’s awful the way she wastes
money.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Over to <span class='fss'>R.</span> of armchair—sternly</i>) If
I had a girl who belonged to me I’d give her an allowance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>and I’d make her keep within it. I hope
your guardian makes you keep within your allowance.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Laughs and shakes her head</i>) No, he
doesn’t. He gives me lots of extra things.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> That won’t do. He’ll spoil you.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Facing him</i>) Oh! But it’s such fun to
be spoiled—(<i>Facing front</i>)—when you never have
been.</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i><span class='sc'>Jervis</span> leans over armchair, looking at her tenderly.
<span class='sc'>Judy</span> reads the expression and turns
abruptly to <span class='fss'>L.</span></i>)</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> And which of all these things did you
choose? (<i>Turns up.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Behind table</i>) This rug—do you like it?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Yes—very pretty.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> And that window seat. (<i>Going up <span class='fss'>C.</span></i>)
It used to be a bureau, but I took off the looking-glass
and upholstered the top. (<i><span class='sc'>Jervis</span> goes up a little
also</i>) You pull the drawers out like steps and
just walk up. (<i>She does it and sits on the top</i>)
Wouldn’t you like to try it, Mr. Pendleton? It’s
very comfortable.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Coming down <span class='fss'>R.</span> of chair and pulling it
up and off of ink spot</i>) I think I’ll stay on dry
land.</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i><span class='sc'>Judy</span>, in consternation, quickly descending from
bureau.</i>)</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Hastily coming down</i>) No, no, no!
(<i><span class='fss'>L.</span> of chair</i>) Now, you’ve done it!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Staring at the spot</i>) What’s that?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Family skeleton. We keep it under the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>chair. I bought the rug for half price because it had
an ink spot.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> A what?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Ink spot.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> You call that a spot? (<i>Cross <span class='fss'>R.</span></i>) I’d call
it a pond.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Sets chair down on spot with a slam</i>)
If people would just leave our furniture alone, it
would never show. (<i>To <span class='fss'>R.</span> of table.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i><span class='fss'>R.</span> of chair</i>) I’m sorry, Miss Judy. I
won’t offend again. But tell me, what sort of a
man is your guardian?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Daddy Long-Legs?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Yes.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Oh, he’s sort of tall—and skinny. He’s
getting a little shaky now, and has to walk with a
cane. He’s bald up here—but he has a nice fringe
of white hair all around here.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Oh, yes, quite a beauty.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> He’s a sweet lamb. And I love him more
than anything in the whole world.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> That must make him very happy.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Facing him</i>) He doesn’t know it. I
wouldn’t tell him to his face. It would spoil him.
(<i>Turns away.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Maybe it would do him good. It would
give him a fresh interest in life to think that a nice
girl like you cared for him.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Suddenly—turning to him. Sits on
table</i>) When I get through college, I’m going to
live with him.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Startled</i>) Are you really? Does he
want you?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Not now. But he will when he knows me
better.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Maybe you’ll change your mind when
you know him better.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Oh, no, I sha’n’t. I have it all planned.
I am going to read out loud to him, and plump up
his pillow, and warm his slippers, and wrap up his
throat in camphorated oil, and <em>always</em> make him
wear his rubbers when he goes out.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Dubiously</i>) That’s very touching.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> I am going to be awfully firm with him.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Oh, you are, are you? (<i><span class='sc'>Judy</span> nods
head</i>) Does he ever come to see you? (<i><span class='sc'>Judy</span>
shakes her head</i>) No? Why not?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> He doesn’t care anything about me, really.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Nonsense, of course he does.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> I just pretend. You must have somebody
to love, and he’s all I have. So I make believe
that he cares.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Maybe he does care—more than you
think.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Facing him, with a flash of fire</i>) No,
he doesn’t! He’s a horrid, cross, old thing, with a
mouth that turns down like that, and a perfectly
dreadful temper.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> So! And doesn’t he ever write to you?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> No!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> And don’t you write to him?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Yes, I write to him all the time—whenever
I get lonely. But he doesn’t even read my
letters.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> How do you know?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> He throws them in the waste basket.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Oh, no, you’re wrong. He keeps them
tied together with a piece of red tape, and locked in
a drawer of his desk, and winter evenings when he’s
all alone in his dark library, he gets them out and
reads them over; and then he sits and looks in the
fire and wonders what little Judy is doing, and
wishes she were there to talk to him.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>(<i><span class='sc'>Judy</span> listens with a pleased smile and faces him.</i>)</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> I like to think he does⸺ (<i>Turning
away</i>) But it’s only pretending. (<i>Crosses <span class='fss'>L.</span> and up
behind chair <span class='fss'>L.</span> of table.</i>)</p>

<div class='c018'><i>WARN CURTAIN</i></div>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> I wonder! I wonder!</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i><span class='sc'>Judy</span> throws of her momentary sadness and faces
him with a sudden change of manner.</i>)</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Do you know that I am a genius?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Are you really?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Yes. That’s why my guardian is sending
me to college. I’m going to be a great author.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> That’s very nice.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>With a quick laugh</i>) Wouldn’t it be a
joke on my guardian, if I turned out not to be a
genius at all—but just a plain girl? (<i>Crossing to <span class='fss'>L.</span>
of table.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> What an idea! Of course you’re a
genius.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Down <span class='fss'>L.</span></i>) Do you think it would be
fair to Daddy Long-Legs, if, after being educated
to be a writer, I should give it up and marry somebody
instead?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Coming to <span class='fss'>R.</span> of table</i>) No! I do not!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> I’ll tell you what I’ll do. I’ll write a
wonderful novel and make an awful lot of money
and give it all to Daddy—and then I’ll be free to
marry anybody I choose.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jimmie.</span> (<i>Entering suddenly and standing by
door</i>) I say, Judy Abbott⸺</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Crossing to him. They exit, laughing and
chatting</i>) Oh, Jimmie! I forgot all about you.

summer, three years later. A <a href='#stage143'>plan</a> and <a href='#scene-3'>full description</a>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Discovered</span>: <i>At rise <span class='sc'>Sallie</span>, seated <span class='fss'>L.</span> of table,
looking more mature and womanly than in the
preceding act, is discovered at rise, interestedly

wearing a slight mustache and dressed in flannels.
He enters, humming a song and carrying
a gun.</i></p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jimmie.</span> (<i>Throws cap on piano</i>) Well—got him!
(<i>Places gun <span class='fss'>R.</span> of what-not.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jimmie.</span> (<i>Crosses to <span class='fss'>L.</span></i>) Woodchuck!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Sallie.</span> (<i>Resumes writing</i>) That’s good!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jimmie.</span> (<i>Crosses to door <span class='fss'>U.</span></i>) Oh—Mrs. Semple!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Semple.</span> (<i>Off stage <span class='fss'>R.</span></i>) Y-e-s⸺</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jimmie.</span> The deed is done. (<i>Turns to <span class='sc'>Sallie</span>,
who pays no attention, crosses <span class='fss'>R.</span> of table</i>) I’ve been
lying on my stomach for two hours, waiting for
that old cuss to stick out his head. Gee, I’m stiff.
(<i>Goes through gymnastics.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Sallie.</span> (<i>Looks up and laughs despairingly</i>) My
dear Jimmie, won’t you ever grow up? You’ve been
out of college two years, and you act like a Freshman.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jimmie.</span> (<i>Turning to mirror over mantel up <span class='fss'>R.</span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>and twirling his mustache</i>) Freshman! Did you
ever see a Freshman with a mustache like that?
(<i><span class='sc'>Sallie</span> resumes writing. To mantel</i>) I say, where
is Judy? (<i>Crosses to <span class='fss'>C.</span> above table.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Sallie.</span> She drove to the village, to send off the
manuscript of her new book.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jimmie.</span> Well, why didn’t she ask me to go
along?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Sallie.</span> You were occupied.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jimmie.</span> (<i>Sits <span class='fss'>R.</span></i>) I could have postponed that
woodchuck until to-morrow.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Sallie.</span> To-morrow! Jimmie McBride, you
must go home to-day. You had no business stopping
off here at all.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jimmie.</span> You visit Judy for two weeks. I
should think I might have two days.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Sallie.</span> Father needs you in the factory.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jimmie.</span> Factory? Work—work—work! It’s
awful the way we men have to work to keep you
women in idleness and luxury.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Sallie.</span> You? Work! Ha! It’s Judy who
knows how to work!</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i><span class='sc'>Mrs. Semple</span> enters <span class='fss'>R.</span> and <span class='sc'>Jimmie</span> rises.</i>)</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mrs. S.</span> (<i>Crossing to <span class='fss'>R.</span> of <span class='sc'>Jimmie</span></i>) Well, did
you get the critter? (<i>Crosses to <span class='fss'>R.</span> of table.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jimmie.</span> (<i>Weeping into his handkerchief</i>) It’s
all over. (<i>Crosses to piano—sits and picks out a one-fingered
tune.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Mrs. S.</span> I’m real glad. He et all the tops off
my young carrots. (<i>Up <span class='fss'>R.</span>, looking around the room—to

Mr. Jervis usually keeps the woodchucks pretty well
shot-up; but he ain’t been here lately.</p>

his nurse and after he growed up, he sort of drifted
off. (<i>Sitting <span class='fss'>R.</span> of table. <span class='sc'>Jimmie</span> at window.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jimmie.</span> (<i>Comes down <span class='fss'>R.</span></i>) Until Miss Judy
commenced coming—and then he sort of drifted
back, eh?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Mrs. S.</span> Oh, he’s awful fond of <em>fishing</em>. (<i>Phone
rings, one long, followed by three short</i>) Telephone!
(<i>Crossing to <span class='fss'>R.</span></i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Sallie.</span> That’s not our number!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Mrs. S.</span> 13! The Weavers! Wonder who’s
talking to ’em? I’ll just find out. (<i>She waddles

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jimmie.</span> (<i>Crossing above table</i>) Don’t you think
it’s darned queer for Jervis Pendleton to be visiting
up here?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Sallie.</span> No! She’s his old nurse!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jimmie.</span> Nurse? Maggie Flannigan is my old
nurse, but I don’t spend my <em>summers</em> with her.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Sallie.</span> (<i>Mocking <span class='sc'>Mrs. S.</span></i>) Mr. Pendleton’s
awful fond of fishing.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jimmie.</span> Fishing! Rats! (<i>Crosses to chair <span class='fss'>R.</span> by

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Mrs. S.</span> (<i>Entering—crosses to up <span class='fss'>R.</span></i>) That was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>Jim Weaver talking to their doctor. It’s awful the
way Jim Weaver swears over the telephone. I
think every lady on the line ought to complain.
Miss Judy had the telephone put in. We never had
one till she came. Don’t know what we’d do without
it now. (<i>Sitting <span class='fss'>R.</span> of table, crosses to <span class='fss'>R.</span> for
workbasket on table and returns to <span class='fss'>R.</span> of table
and sits and begins work on knitting</i>) Miss
Judy does have more ideas! The first summer
she was here she and Mr. Jervis knocked out the
whole wall side of the house and had that window
put in. Makes it look like all outdoors. It’s fine
for the summer, but they ain’t here in the winter.
(<i>Grunt. Workbasket on table</i>) And then she had
that piano put in tuther room. The last I heard,
they was planning a pergolley in the garden. But
he ain’t been up here for a month or so and I guess
the pergolley notion has sort of dropped. I don’t
know what she’ll think of next.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jimmie.</span> (<i>Rises, twirling mustache with self-satisfied
air</i>) She’ll be getting married next, and
then⸺</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Mrs. S.</span> (<i>Looks across at <span class='sc'>Jimmie</span></i>) When she
does marry, I hope it will be to a man that amounts
to something, and not to some trifling, good-for-nothing
young fellow who’s afraid of work.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jimmie.</span> (<i>Gives himself a burlesque punch and
turns up</i>) Ooh!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Mrs. S.</span> (<i>Putting workbasket on table</i>) Land

does your train go? I mustn’t let you miss it!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jimmie.</span> (<i>Sweetly</i>) Thanks!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Mrs. S.</span> Too bad you weren’t here when Miss
Judy left; she could a-carried you to the station.</p>

seven children I’d bob up the next day and hunt for

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Crossing to <span class='sc'>Mrs. Semple</span></i>) A surprise?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Mrs. S.</span> (<i>Crossing down to door <span class='fss'>R.</span></i>) Something
you ain’t expecting!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>To chair <span class='fss'>R.</span> of table</i>) What is it?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Mrs. S.</span> (<i>Shaking her head</i>) I ain’t going to

<span class='sc'>Judy’s</span> attitude.</i>)</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sallie.</span> (<i>Rising from piano. Standing above
table</i>) What’s the matter, Judy? (<i>Crossing to <span class='fss'>L.</span> of
table</i>) Don’t worry about what that old publisher
says. He hasn’t even read the book. It’s the best
thing you’ve ever written.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Standing <span class='fss'>L.</span></i>) Because it’s true!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Sallie.</span> It’s wonderful, Judy—the imagination
you have! Why, the atmosphere of that asylum
seems as real as though you’d seen it with your
own eyes. I don’t know how you do it! I couldn’t
picture the inside of an asylum and the way a little
orphan girl feels—not if my life depended on it.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Slowly rising</i>) It didn’t require any
imagination. Those are the things that really do
happen.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Sallie.</span> (<i>To front of table</i>) Yes, but how, how
do you know? (<i>Sits on stool, facing <span class='sc'>Judy</span>.</i>)</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i><span class='sc'>Judy</span> turns away from <span class='sc'>Sallie</span> and faces up stage,

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Oh, Sallie! I want to tell you <em>the truth</em>.
I can’t stand it any longer—this pretending and pretending
to be something I am not. I don’t belong
with all you other girls, who have homes and families.
I try to be silly and laughing and care-free
like the rest of you; but—I’m only an impostor.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Sallie.</span> What do you mean?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> You wondered that I knew so well how
the little orphan girl felt. I knew because—I myself
was that little girl.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Sallie.</span> You!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> My childhood was one long, sullen stretch
of revolt. I was brought up in an asylum—in blue-checked
gingham. Oh, I feel sometimes—(<i><span class='sc'>Sallie</span>
sympathetically puts her arm on <span class='sc'>Judy’s</span> shoulder</i>)—as
if those miserable checks had stamped themselves
on my very soul. And then one day—suddenly—like
a miracle, Daddy Long-Legs came and
lifted me out of all that misery—and gave me freedom
and a chance to live. Oh, I was delirious with
joy. I thought every trouble in the world was
ended.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Sallie.</span> I can imagine what it would mean to
lose one’s parents.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> I don’t know what I am or where I came
from. Oh, I try to be sensible and courageous, but
I feel sometimes as though I could never escape from
the shadow of my childhood. I dream about it at
night, I wake up shivering in the dark, feeling as
though I must run faster and faster, because Mrs.
Lippett is after me with her arm outstretched to
grab me back.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Sallie.</span> Why, Judy, you’re growing morbid. All
this makes no difference.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Not with you, perhaps. But to others⸺</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Sallie.</span> Who?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Well, do you think Julia Pendleton’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>mother would have let her daughter associate with
me if she had known? I know how much they think
of family.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Sallie.</span> It doesn’t matter what the Pendletons
think.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> And perhaps they know already.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Sallie.</span> Why?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Well—Jervis—Mr. Pendleton used to
come here frequently for a few days’ fishing and he
and I became very good friends. We went tramping
and fished for trout, read books together and
had such good times. But for a long while now he
has stayed away and I wonder why. Unless—he
has learned the truth. (<i>Rises.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Sallie.</span> (<i>Rising also</i>) It doesn’t matter, Judy,
he doesn’t count. Some day some other man will
come and ask you to be his wife.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> And I would have to <em>tell him</em> about the
<em>John Grier Home</em>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Sallie.</span> (<i>Putting her arm around <span class='sc'>Judy’s</span> waist</i>)
He would marry you just the same.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Yes—through kindness perhaps—through
pity. But when I told him if I saw a look of doubt
on his face, if I saw the slightest shadow, oh, Sallie—(<i>Turning
to <span class='sc'>Sallie</span></i>)—I couldn’t <em>bear</em> it! It
would <em>kill</em> me! (<i>Sobs and buries her head on <span class='sc'>Sallie’s</span>
shoulder. <span class='sc'>Sallie</span> tenderly mothers her.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Sallie.</span> (<i>After a pause; lifts <span class='sc'>Judy’s</span> head</i>) Oh,
Judy! You speak as though someone has already
come. (<i><span class='sc'>Judy</span> shakes her head, and slowly crosses to
<span class='fss'>L.</span></i>) Has someone already come?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<span class='fss'>L.C.</span>) No, no! I was only pretending.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Sallie.</span> (<i>Following <span class='sc'>Judy</span> a step</i>) But he’ll come
and be proud to do so. You are going to be a
famous author.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> I don’t want fame. (<i>Crosses to staircase</i>)
I just want—happiness.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Crossing to <span class='sc'>Sallie</span></i>) Ah, Miss McBride—this

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> And how are you, Mr. Pendleton?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Coming down <span class='fss'>C.</span> and then front of

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Cautiously, too, like old Grover, under the

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Oh, that’s not fair. Your imagination

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> It’s flattering to know that—you still take

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> I shall never cease to do that, not for a

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> That is difficult to believe.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> Well—five weeks away and not a word or
sign or token.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Yet every moment of those weeks you’ve
been in my thoughts. I went away, I stayed away

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> (<i>Apprehensively</i>) About me?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Concerning both of us—the truth of
which has forced itself upon me, and it became a
problem I’ve been trying hard to solve.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Judy.</span> A problem? How⸺</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Sitting <span class='fss'>R.</span> of table</i>) A conflict of my
heart and mind in which I can find no peace. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>so I’ve come back to ask that you decide. The freedom
of our comradeship has gone and I am a dependent
now upon your answer. I love you, Judy.</p>

<div class='c018'><i>WARN</i></div>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> With a love so deep, so great that it overpowers
what the world would call my sense of right,
but how could I help it? You came into my gray
existence like a spirit of Spring and sunshine, bringing
to it an interest that I had never known. But
the difference of our years forbade that I should
recognize the truth and so I deceived myself that
your friendship was my sole desire. And the play-time
of my life began. And then the thought thrust
itself upon me that I was deceiving <em>you</em>. My reason
mocked and ridiculed my love. That I, past youth,
should offer youth the remnant of a life … and
so I went away to fight it out alone. I feared perhaps
your sympathy might lead you into that greatest
sacrifice, a loveless marriage. Then hope transformed
me with the thought that in my great love,
you might find some measure of content. And so,
quite conquered, beaten in the struggle between my
reason and my love, I ask your aid, remembering
always that beyond all else your own happiness is at
stake. Have no thought of the hurt that might come
to me, and yet, if somewhere in your heart there is
a spark of feeling for me that my devotion might
warm into a glow of love, oh, give me the blessed
chance to try—and so, dear heart, I’m waiting—fearing—hoping—will
you be my wife? (<i>Pause.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Griggs.</span> The wound is entirely healed. But he
doesn’t improve as much as we could wish. He’s
very low in spirits!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> I am so sorry! I’ve been away, and I
only just heard about the accident this morning.
How did it happen?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Griggs.</span> It happened four weeks ago, on a hunting
trip in Canada. The gun exploded and he got
his hand poisoned.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> How dreadful! Is he able to see people?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Griggs.</span> He’ll be able to see you, Miss Pritchard.
You’re such an old friend, but he’s hardly
strong enough for relatives yet.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> Where is he?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Griggs.</span> Well, the doctor’s with him just at this
moment—if you don’t mind waiting⸺</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> Not in the least. But I’ve been shopping
all the afternoon, and I’m nearly famished.
(<i>Rises</i>) I think I’ll beg a cup of tea from the housekeeper.
(<i>Turns as if to go, and <span class='sc'>Griggs</span> turns to
desk to ring bell for housekeeper</i>) Oh, don’t trouble.
I know the way. She and I are old friends! (<i>Crosses
up to <span class='fss'>C.</span>, and <span class='sc'>Griggs</span> turns to desk to resume writing.
<span class='sc'>Miss Pritchard</span> turns at <span class='fss'>C.</span></i>) Oh, Mr. Griggs,
I asked a young lady to meet me here. Should she
come, will you please let me know?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Griggs.</span> Certainly. (<i>Sits at desk.</i>)</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i><span class='sc'>Miss Pritchard</span> exits off <span class='fss'>C.</span> and <span class='fss'>L.</span> and <span class='sc'>Walters</span>
comes downstairs and into the room.</i>)</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Walters.</span> (<i>Up stage <span class='fss'>R.</span> of arch</i>) Oh, Mr. Griggs—the
doctor is just going! And Mr. Pendleton is
coming down.</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i><span class='sc'>Jervis</span> comes downstairs, preceded by <span class='sc'>Doctor</span>.
They stand at foot of stairs as <span class='sc'>Walters</span> exits
<span class='fss'>R.</span> to open door for <span class='sc'>Doctor</span>.</i>)</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Shaking hands with <span class='sc'>Doctor</span></i>) All
right, Doctor, I’ll behave. I’ll follow directions—good-bye!
(<i><span class='sc'>Doctor</span> exits off <span class='fss'>R.</span> and <span class='sc'>Jervis</span> comes
into the room <span class='fss'>C.</span> He wears a long dressing gown,
and is pale and somewhat irritable</i>) Oh, good afternoon,
Griggs!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Griggs.</span> (<i>Crossing to <span class='fss'>R.</span> of <span class='sc'>Jervis</span></i>) Good afternoon,
Mr. Pendleton. I trust you are feeling better.</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i><span class='sc'>Walters</span> crosses at back and goes upstairs off <span class='fss'>L.</span></i>)</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Yes, yes! Thanks! A good deal better.
(<i>Crossing to armchair front of fire.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Griggs.</span> (<i>Crossing to desk <span class='fss'>R.</span> for papers</i>) Do you
feel able to take up the matter of those bonds?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> No, not just yet. But there is a matter
I wish to discuss. You remember that several
months ago I spoke to you about settling a certain
definite sum upon Miss Abbott?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Griggs.</span> Yes, sir, I remember.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> That was before my accident, and I’ve
not yet had a chance to arrange the matter. I want
you to look up some good securities. Something
paying about six per cent, you know, stability—that’s
what I want! You understand?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Griggs.</span> Yes, sir, I understand. I’ll make a list.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Be good enough to attend to that immediately.
And, Griggs, I want you to take
down a letter—(<i><span class='sc'>Griggs</span> takes note-book from desk
and comes to <span class='fss'>C.</span> above table, ready to receive notes</i>)—to
Miss Abbott. Something to the effect that
Mr. Smith has been led to believe that she is considering
the question of marriage with Mr. James
McBride, and that, if her happiness is at stake, he
approves of the step, and wishes her every joy.
Then put in a word about Mr. Smith’s belief that a
married woman ought to be independent of her husband
in financial matters; and that he has created a
little trust fund which he sends as a wedding present.
Say he feels that with her final settlement in
life, his own share in her career is at an end. That
he thanks her for the four years of charming letters
she has been good enough to send and with this
final expression of his esteem he begs to remove
his shadowy presence from her life. Sign it—(<i><span class='sc'>Walters</span>
comes downstairs with tray and medicine to <span class='fss'>L.</span>
of table</i>)—and bring it to me to look over. (<i>Sinks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>into armchair as though exhausted. He seems in a
moment to have become the old man that <span class='sc'>Judy</span> thinks
him.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Griggs.</span> And you’ll attend later to the matter of
those bonds?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Yes, yes, that’s all just now. I’m not
up to much business yet.</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i><span class='sc'>Griggs</span> up and exits off <span class='fss'>L.</span> <span class='sc'>Walters</span> comes down
to <span class='fss'>R.</span> of armchair. On tray he has a medicine
bottle, partly filled, a glass and a medicine graduate.</i>)</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Walters.</span> Your medicine, sir.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Very quietly</i>) Take it away! It doesn’t
do any good!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Walters.</span> But, if you please, sir, the doctor
said⸺</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Rising, crossing to <span class='fss'>R.</span> of table</i>) Oh, take
it away!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Walters.</span> (<i>Following him to <span class='fss'>R.</span></i>) Now, Mr. Jervis,
you should have taken it at four o’clock. It’s
half past now, and the other kind comes at five. It
isn’t best to mix them, sir. They ought to come in
layers. (<i>Places tray on corner of table. The drinking
glass placed handily for <span class='sc'>Jervis</span>. Sits <span class='fss'>R.</span> of
table.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Walters, you’re a good man, but you’re
obstinate. Now, when I say a thing, I mean it.
(<i>Sits <span class='fss'>R.</span> of table.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Walters.</span> (<i>With patient persistency</i>) But Mr.
Jervis, you promised the doctor that if he’d let the
nurse go, you wouldn’t make any trouble for me.
(<i>Takes graduate in left hand and bottle in right.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Rises and takes glass in <span class='fss'>R.</span> hand</i>) Oh,
very well.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span><span class='sc'>Walters.</span> (<i>Starting to pour medicine</i>) One
teaspoon, sir. Just one.</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i><span class='sc'>Jervis</span> takes bottle from <span class='sc'>Walters</span> and begins to
pour the contents into the glass, then drinks it
as the horrified <span class='sc'>Walters</span> takes bottle from him,
remonstrating. <span class='sc'>Jervis</span> sets glass on the tray and
turns to <span class='sc'>Walters</span>.</i>)</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> There! I have taken the whole lot.
Now, I hope you’re satisfied. Don’t let me hear
the word “medicine” again! (<i>Sits <span class='fss'>R.</span> of table, <span class='sc'>Walters</span>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> (<i>Behind <span class='sc'>Jervis</span>, kissing him on cheek
over <span class='fss'>L.</span> shoulder</i>) Hello, Uncle Jervis! (<i>Crossing to
<span class='fss'>R.</span></i>) Feeling better?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Surprised</i>) How did you get in?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Through the basement—along with the
butcher. You are going to have chicken for dinner.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Umph! Thanks!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> That brute of a Walters will never let
me in.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> He has orders.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> This is the third time I’ve called. And
your own relative.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Julia, I’m not well enough to talk, the
doctor says I have to keep quiet.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> You can’t fool me. You see lots of people.
You are just cross.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Rising</i>) Yes, that’s it—I’m cross! I
am not fit company for anyone! (<i>Crossing to <span class='fss'>L.</span> of
table and sits</i>) Now you run along.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> (<i>Crosses to <span class='fss'>R.</span> of <span class='sc'>Jervis</span>, above table</i>) Ah,
nunkey, don’t be cross. I won’t bother you. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>I want your advice about something important. I
want you to talk to mother.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> No—no! I’m not strong enough to talk
to your mother.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Oh, please, Uncle Jervis, it’s very important!
Please!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Well, well, what is it?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> (<i>Resting on chair <span class='fss'>L.</span> of table</i>) Mother’s
picked out someone <em>she</em> wants me to marry.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Well, marry him!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> But I don’t like him!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Why don’t you like him?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Well, he’s got a long mustache that looks
like a chicken wing, and no chin.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Very well, don’t marry him!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> And <em>I’ve</em> picked out exactly the man I
<em>do want</em> to marry.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Very well, then marry him.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Mother doesn’t think he’s good enough to
marry me.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Nonsense! Anybody’s good enough to
marry you.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> (<i>Rising and crossing to his <span class='fss'>L.</span></i>) Uncle Jervis!
(<i>Cross <span class='fss'>L.</span></i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> No, no—I don’t mean that!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> I tell you now if she doesn’t let me, I’ll
elope.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Yes, please elope!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Yes, but I don’t want to elope. (<i>Sits on
arm of armchair.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Why don’t you want to elope?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> I want some wedding presents.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> If you’ll only elope, and leave me alone,
I’ll give you a wedding present. I’ll give you twenty
presents. (<i>Crosses <span class='fss'>R.</span></i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Yes, but won’t you talk to mother?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> What’s her objection?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Well, his father owns a factory.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> A factory?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Yes—makes—overalls.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Puzzled</i>) Overalls?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Yes—you know! Things that wind up
and over. Mother doesn’t think they’re nice!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> What’s his name?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Jimmie McBride.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Rising</i>) Did he ask you?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> (<i>Laughing</i>) Yes, of course he did.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Turning front</i>) I don’t understand⸺</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Oh, I see. You thought he was heart-broken
over Judy Abbott. He liked her. She’s a
nice girl, but he’s in love with me.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Shakes hands vigorously</i>) Well, I’m
delighted to hear it! Now you run on and elope.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Yes, but the wedding presents?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Swings her around to <span class='fss'>R.</span> of him</i>) I’ll
give you all the wedding presents you want if you’ll
only elope.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> (<i>Working up <span class='fss'>C.</span> to <span class='fss'>C.L.</span></i>) I’ll take a country
house⸺</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Yes.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> A pearl necklace⸺</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Yes, yes!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> And a touring car!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Anything you want, but for goodness’
sake elope!</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i><span class='sc'>Miss Pritchard</span> enters to <span class='fss'>R.</span> of <span class='sc'>Julia</span> at <span class='fss'>C.</span></i>)</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> (<i>Turning to <span class='sc'>Miss Pritchard</span></i>) Oh, Miss
Pritchard! Don’t stay. He’s in a dreadful temper!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Oh, yes—please stay!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Oh!—Well, good-bye, Mr. Bear—and
don’t forget my presents. (<i>She exits up and off <span class='fss'>R.</span></i>)</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>(<i><span class='sc'>Miss Pritchard</span> crosses to <span class='sc'>Jervis</span>, shaking hands.</i>)</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> This is a pleasure!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> You’re sure I won’t tire you?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Sits <span class='fss'>R.</span></i>) Tire me—no—no! Here—sit
down! (<i>Crossing to armchair</i>) I’m already tired
to death of my own company. (<i>Swings armchair
around to face chair <span class='fss'>L.</span> of table</i>) Another week of
this and I’ll be strangling Walters, just for the sake
of a little excitement. (<i><span class='sc'>Miss Pritchard</span> crosses and
sits in armchair</i>) You don’t mind if I prowl about?
(<i>Crosses over to <span class='fss'>R.</span></i>) I’ve been shut up so long that I
feel like a caged hyena. (<i>Crosses up back to <span class='fss'>C.</span> behind
table.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> I hear that Julia’s engaged⸺</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='tn-missing'></a><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> And I thought he was interested in our
little Judy!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> The same idea crossed my mind.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> Jervis! (<i>He faces her. Crosses to her.
She rises</i>) I came to talk to you about Judy.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Yes?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> (<i>Crossing to him eagerly</i>) Are you sure
I won’t bore you?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> No, no! Sit down! Please go on!
(<i><span class='sc'>Miss Pritchard</span> sits <span class='fss'>L.</span> of table and <span class='sc'>Jervis</span> at fireplace.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> She’s not happy!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> What’s the matter?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> She is brooding over something.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> It’s that young McBride. If that confounded
young cub⸺ (<i>Rising.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> No. I’ve seen his sister and I know it’s
not that.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> What is it, then?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> Jervis, I’m going to talk to you quite
frankly.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Sits again</i>) Go on, say anything you
like!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> Well, then—I think you have been very
much in the wrong in your dealings with Judy.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> What more could I do?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> I don’t mean as her guardian—John
Smith—Daddy Long-Legs—whatever you wish to
call yourself—I am speaking of your behavior in
your own character, as Jervis Pendleton.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> What have I done?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> You have been playing a double part.
As Judy’s guardian you made her spend her vacation
on that farm. Then as Jervis Pendleton, you
went and visited her.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> You’re not insinuating⸺</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> I’m not insinuating. I know that you
have been very unthoughtful of her happiness!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> I’ve thought of nothing else for four
years!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> Yes, to you it meant nothing, but you
were simply amused in watching the child’s development.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> My dear lady⸺</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> But it was very unfair to Judy. She is
an abnormally inexperienced child. She has been
shut away from the world all her life, and then to
be thrown with a man like you⸺</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Like me?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> With your knowledge of the world—your
experience. It’s a type that is very fascinating
to a young girl!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> I? Fascinating? Why, I’m old and
world-weary and done for. Little Judy is standing
on the edge of life. What chance would I have of
interesting her?</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='tn-impossible'></a><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> Of course I know it’s impossible. A
girl of her antecedents⸺</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> That’s nothing to me and you know it.
I don’t care where she comes from—Judy is herself,
that’s all I care! But this is beside the point.
The girl is not interested in me, except as she is interested
in every human being.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> I am not sure!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> I am! You have let your imagination
run away with you.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> On one thing I am going to insist. She
must know the truth about Daddy Long-Legs!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Why spoil her illusions? She looks upon
me as a nice, fatherly old man. I am neither quite
so nice, nor quite so fatherly as she thinks.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> This mystery has gone too far!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Don’t you see the position you place me
in? She already knows me as a friend. I can’t
appear now as a benefactor, demanding gratitude
and a reward.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> I understand. (<i>Rises</i>) Jervis, last
week she sent her guardian a letter.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Why, she hasn’t sent a word in two
months.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> Begging him to advise her about something
important.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> Are you sure?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Miss P.</span> Yes.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Jervis.</span> (<i>Starts</i>) I’ve never received it. They’ve
been keeping my letters back. (<i>Rises, and starts to
cross <span class='fss'>R.</span> to ring for <span class='sc'>Griggs</span>. <span class='sc'>Miss Pritchard</span> places
restraining hand on his arm.</i>)</p>

as though all the light had gone out of the world for
me—and then—when I learned that I was to see
Daddy Long-Legs! He has made things right for
me before—maybe he can do it again! Oh, I was
so excited that I couldn’t sleep last night—not a
single wink. Mrs. Semple called me this morning
at four o’clock. I ate breakfast in the kitchen by
candle light, and drove five miles to the station
through the most glorious October dawn. The sun
came up and all of the trees were crimson, and the
cornfields and stone walls covered with frost—the
air was so clear and keen and promising. I just
felt something was going to happen! And all the
way in the train, the rails kept singing: “You’re going
to see Daddy Long-Legs! You’re going to see
Daddy Long-Legs!” And all the time I had the
feeling that maybe before the journey ended, I
should see someone else—someone dearer—dearer
than Daddy…. (<i>She turns to hide her tears from

    <div><span class='large'>MRS. TEMPLE’S TELEGRAM.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>A most successful farce in three acts, by Frank Wyatt and William
Morris. 5 males, 4 females. One interior scene stands throughout
the three acts. Costumes modern. Plays 2½ hours.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mrs. Temple’s Telegram” is a sprightly farce in which there is
an abundance of fun without any taint of impropriety or any element
of offence. As noticed by Sir Walter Scott, “Oh, what a
tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.”</p>

<p class='c005'>There is not a dull moment in the entire farce, and from the time
the curtain rises until it makes the final drop the fun is fast and
furious.
A very exceptional farce. <span class="price"><span class='small'>Price, 60 Cents.</span></span></p>

    <div><span class='large'>THE NEW CO-ED.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>A comedy in four acts, by Marie Doran, author of “Tempest and
Sunshine,” etc. Characters, 4 males, 7 females, though any number
of boys and girls can be introduced in the action of the play. One
interior and one exterior scene, but can be easily played in one interior
scene. Costumes modern. Time, about 2 hours.</p>

<p class='c005'>The theme of this play is the coming of a new student to the college,
her reception by the scholars, her trials and final triumph.</p>

<p class='c005'>There are three especially good girls’ parts, Letty, Madge and
Estelle, but the others have plenty to do. “Punch” Doolittle and
George Washington Watts, a gentleman of color, are two particularly
good comedy characters. We can strongly recommend “The New
Co-Ed” to high schools
and amateurs. <span class="price"><span class='small'>Price, 30 Cents.</span></span></p>

<p class='c001'>Stage directions are spaced inconsistently in the original printed text (e.g., “R. I. E.” vs. “R.I.E.”) and are reproduced here as they appear in print. On <a href='#tn-embraces'>p. 25</a>, a stage direction has an orphan embrace Judy before she has entered; on <a href='#tn-missing'>p. 104</a> there appears to be a missing or misattributed line, as Jervis is given two lines in a row (beginning “And I thought…” and “The same idea…”). As the correction is not clear in either case, the passages have been left as printed.</p>

<p class='c027'><a href='#tn-codman-line'>One line</a> and <a href='#tn-codman-sd'>one stage direction</a> in Act 1 reference a character named “Codman,” who does not appear elsewhere in the play but appears to be one of the Trustees; this is possibly intended to be Wykoff.</p>

<p class='c027'>Below is a list of itemized changes from the original text. Other minor inconsistencies, such as differences in hyphenation (e.g. “armchair” vs. “arm-chair”, “carefree” vs. “care-free”), have been left as printed.</p>
